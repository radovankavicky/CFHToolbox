CFH Toolbox
======
**CFH Toolbox** is a Matlab implementation of characteristic function 
transform methods for financial applications. It allows for the evaluation 
of general affine jump diffusion processes in terms of option prices or pdf
recovery. 

I will happily discuss or improve any parts of the toolbox.

Next updates (or your contributions) will include:
- A compendium of characteristic functions (so far included: BS, BS+Merton jumps, Heston, Heston+Merton jumps)
- A compendium of jump transforms (so far included: Merton and Exponential)
- Multiple jump types components as described in appendix B of the DPS2000 paper.
- Time dependent parameters



## Usage
The toolbox contains a fleshed out help file. Simply clone and either run 
the file _install.m_.

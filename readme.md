CFH Toolbox
======
**CFH Toolbox** is a Matlab implementation of characteristic function 
transform methods for financial applications. It allows for the evaluation 
of general affine jump diffusion processes in terms of option prices or pdf
recovery. 

I will happily discuss or improve any parts of the toolbox.


## Usage
The toolbox contains a fleshed out help file. Simply clone and either run 
the file _install.m_.
